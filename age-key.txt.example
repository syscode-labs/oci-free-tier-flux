# Generate your own Age key with: age-keygen -o age-key.txt

# 2. Stored securely
# 3. NEVER committed to Git
# 4. Backed up securely (loss means you cannot decrypt secrets)
#
# Usage:
#   age-keygen -o age-key.txt
#   # Copy the public key from output to .sops.yaml
#   # Store age-key.txt in cluster: kubectl create secret generic sops-age ...
