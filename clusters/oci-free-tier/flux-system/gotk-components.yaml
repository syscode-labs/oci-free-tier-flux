# Flux CD Components
#
# This file should be generated using Flux CLI:
#
#   flux install --export > clusters/oci-free-tier/flux-system/gotk-components.yaml
#
# Alternatively, this file is not strictly needed since we reference the
# official Flux install manifest directly in Talos config:
#
#   - https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/download/v2.4.0/install.yaml
#
# This file is kept as a placeholder for reference, but the bootstrap
# process uses the URL above instead.
#
# TODO: Generate with flux install --export if you want to customize Flux components
